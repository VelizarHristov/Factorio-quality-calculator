# Factorio quality calculator

This is WIP with some features already working. This is my to-do list:

- Calculate machine speeds and speed modules
- Support "I want X quality or better" - for example someone might have unlocked legendary but wants rare or better, then display the number of inputs needed to make a single rare or better, and the ratios of rare:epic:legendary they'll be getting
- Calculate multi-step processes (e.g. if there's the recipe chain A -> B -> C, and someone wanted to calculate the number of normal-quality As needed to make a legendary C)
- Pull down all recipes in the game, let the user choose from them

If there's a feature that you wish to see, please open it as an Issue and I will consider adding it if it's in scope. The scope is anything that helps the user build production of quality items, which isn't already well covered by YAFC.
